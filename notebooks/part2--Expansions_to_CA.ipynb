    "In this part of the tutorial, we look at ways to expand upon the cellular automata model, and to make the model more expressive. In the original version, in keeping with Conway's Game of Life, we made many assumptions including deterministic behavior, synchronous updates, and cells that could live indefinitely. In this section we examine each of these assumptions and how to go forego them, in an attempt to more closely mimic characteristics a real population might have."

    "Unlike the original model we developed in section 1, we now explore asynchronous updates to the grid world. This means that instead of updating states as a function of only the previous state, we now update the cells in-place as a function of all prior updates, updating one cell at a time and allowing that to affect subsequent updates. This method of updating the states of cells may better mimic a real population because a whole population doesn't have all births and deaths occur so simultaneously, and instead one death or birth may affect other processes.\n",
