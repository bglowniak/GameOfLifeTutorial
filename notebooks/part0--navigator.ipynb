    "# Cellular Automata and Game of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "This X-part tutorial examines the use of cellular automation as a simple yet powerful modeling technique for discrete systems. We utilize John Conway's Game of Life, a well-known example of this approach, as a vehicle to first explore the basic concepts, then to investigate methods of analyzing and expanding upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Part 1 - Introduction to CA and Game of Life](part1--ca_intro.ipynb): This first tutorial explores the basic methodologies and terminologies of cellular auomation as well as introducing Game of Life via a Python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Rough Outline:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 2 - Expansions to Cellular Automata - exploring stochasticity, async updates, time-to-live, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 3 - Techniques for Analysis - we should probably do analysis in the first tutorials (i.e. density plots), but this tutorial is meant to explore Mean Field approximation, possibly phase space approximation, graph of state transitions? Not sure if this should be a separate tutorial or integrated into the other ones\n",
