    "# Cellular Automata and Game of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "This X-part tutorial examines the use of cellular automata as a simple yet powerful modeling technique for discrete systems. We utilize John Conway's Game of Life, a well-known example of this approach, as a vehicle to first explore the basic concepts, then to investigate methods of analyzing and expanding upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Part 1 - Introduction to CA and Game of Life](part1--ca_intro.ipynb): This first tutorial explores the basic methodologies and terminologies of cellular auomation as well as introducing Game of Life via a Python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGH OUTLINE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 2 - Expansions to Cellular Automata - exploring stochasticity, async updates, time-to-live, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 3 - Techniques for Analysis - we will need analysis in the first tutorials (i.e. density plots, maybe state transition graphs?), but this tutorial is meant to explore Mean Field approximation, possibly phase space approximation, also using cobweb plots and stuff? Not sure if this should be a separate tutorial or integrated into the other ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 4 - Exploring Emergent Behavior in Game of Life - exploring oscillators, pulsars, blinkers, and then diving into logic gates and information signals using glider guns, sierpinski triangle\n",
