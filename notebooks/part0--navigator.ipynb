    "# Cellular Automata and Game of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "This 4-part tutorial examines the use of cellular automata as a simple yet powerful modeling technique for discrete systems. We utilize John Conway's Game of Life, a well-known example of this approach, as a vehicle to first explore the basic concepts, then to investigate methods of analyzing and expanding upon it.\n",

    "## Tutorial Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Part 1 - Introduction to CA and Game of Life](part1--ca_intro.ipynb): This first tutorial explores the basic methodologies and terminologies of cellular auomation as well as introducing Game of Life via a Python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "ROUGH OUTLINE:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 2 - Expansions to Cellular Automata - exploring stochasticity, async updates, time-to-live, \n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 3 - Techniques for Analysis - phase space approximation, then mean field approximation (including cobweb plots). Compare mean field approximation to density plots. All of this analysis is from 12.3 and 12.4 of Sayama.\n",
    "\n",
    "* Part 4 - Exploring Emergent Behavior in Game of Life - exploring oscillators, pulsars, blinkers, and then diving into logic gates and information signals using glider guns, sierpinski triangle\n",
