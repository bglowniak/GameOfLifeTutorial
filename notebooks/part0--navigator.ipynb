    "# Cellular Automata and Game of Life\n",
    "\n",
    "This 4-part tutorial examines the use of cellular automata as a simple yet powerful modeling technique for discrete systems. We utilize John Conway's Game of Life, a well-known example of this approach, as a vehicle to first explore the basic concepts, then to investigate methods of analyzing and expanding upon it.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tutorial Contents\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Part 1 - Introduction to CA and Game of Life](part1--ca_intro.ipynb): This first tutorial explores the basic methodologies and terminologies of cellular auomation as well as introducing Game of Life via a Python implementation.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Part 2 - Expansions to Cellular Automata](part2--Expansions_to_CA.ipynb) - This tutorial experiments with extensions to the Game of Life, showing ways to explore and improve upon cellular automata.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Part 3 - Exploring Patterns in Game of Life](part4--patterns.ipynb) - In this final tutorial, we investigate how complex behavior and patterns can emerge in even a simple CA.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Scripts\n",
    "\n",
    "All code for this tutorial can be found within our Github repo at https://github.gatech.edu/bglowniak3/CX-4230-Project-1/tree/master/scripts. The interested reader is invited to play around with these scripts to gain further insight into CA and Game of Life.\n",
