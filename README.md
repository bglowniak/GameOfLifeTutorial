# CX 4230 Project 1

We plan to utilize Conway's Game of Life to explore the concept of cellular automata. We will then dive deeper into the model, first exploring the various phenomena that can arise from it, then increasing the complexity and performing further analysis. Examples of complexity include, but are not limited to, implementing asynchronous updates, adding stochasticity to the model, adding an element of time, and exploring how logic gates and information transfer can arise from a seemingly simple model.

This repository currently contains a Python script implementing a basic version of Game of Life as well as our Checkpoint 1 Report.
